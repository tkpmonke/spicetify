## Usage

**Manual installation** 

1. Follow the installation instructions for [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started)
   * Note: The installation instructions for linux have you setting `/opt/spotify` and `/opt/spotify/Apps/*` permissions to `777`. This is not good practice and should be avoided. If you want, you can set the group ownership for these paths to one that your user is apart of (i.e. `users`), or you can create a new group and add it as a secondary group to your user. After that you can use the following command to give access to the group:
      ```
      GROUP=<group_name>
      sudo chgrp $GROUP /opt/spotify
      sudo chgrp -R $GROUP /opt/spotify/Apps
      sudo chmod 775 /opt/spotify
      sudo chmod 775 -R /opt/spotify/Apps
      ```

2. Follow the [installation and basic usage guide](https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started) to setup Spicetify

3. Clone/Download the repository, and place the `catppuccin` folder (containing `user.css`, `theme.js`, `color.ini`, and `assets`) in the `Spicetify/Themes` directory:
      ```
      # UNIX
      cp -r catppuccin ~/.config/spicetify/Themes/
      
      # Windows
      cp catppuccin "$(spicetify -c | Split-Path)\Themes\" -Recurse
      ```

4. Set theme and color scheme. Supported color schemes: `frappe`, `latte`, `macchiato`, `mocha`.:
   ```
   spicetify config current_theme catppuccin
   spicetify config color_scheme mocha 
   spicetify config inject_css 1 inject_theme_js 1 replace_colors 1 overwrite_assets 1
   spicetify apply
   ```
5. To set an accent color, head over to Spotify's settings page and select the accent colour.
